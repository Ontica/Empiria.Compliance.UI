# Empiria Compliance UI Web Application

Angular-based front-end application for the Empiria Compliance System.

## Quick start

This project is being built with Angular version 13.2.6 and TypeScript 4.5.5.

It uses [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), so both the CLI and generated project, have dependencies that require Node 12 or higher, together with NPM 6 or higher.

**Make sure you have Node version >= 12 and NPM >= 6**

**Then install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (globally if possible), ensuring that you have installed **version 13** or higher.

```bash
# install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# check Angular CLI, Angular and TypeScript versions
ng -v
```

After that, please download and install this repo:

```bash
# clone (or fork) this repo
git clone https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Compliance.UI

# change directory
cd Empiria.Compliance.UI

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# Use Angular CLI to start the server
ng serve --open
```

By default, you have to navigate to [http://localhost:2022](http://localhost:2022) to see the application running.
